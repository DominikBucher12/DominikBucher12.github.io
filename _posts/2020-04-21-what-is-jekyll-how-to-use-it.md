# Installation

### Creating a new Jekyll site
**We can create a new Jekyll site just by a simple command:**<br>
> # `jekyll new my-site`

Jekyll will create a new directory named as `my-site` which is customizable (i.e., you can change the name from `my-site` to anything you want for example `jekyll new brutus`).

### Changing into the Directory
**We have to go inside the directory:**<br>
> # `cd my-site`

Again, `my-site` is just a random name which is customizable.

### Building the site and making it available on a local server
> # `bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Browsing your Jekyll site
> # Browse to [`http://localhost:4000/`](http://localhost:4000/){:target="_blank"}
